# Assignment 2.05 - Data Driven Actor Creation

## Primary Requirements

- Link Lua, or some other embeddable scripting language, into your game.
- Add a function, such as Actor * Engine::CreateActor( const char * i_pScriptFilename ), that parses a script in your choosen scripting language and creates a new Actor / GameObject from it, including any related objects (Renderable, PhysicsInfo, etc.)
- Use this system to create your player and enemies.
- Remove any existing code that manually created the player or enemies.

## Secondary Requirements

- Ensure your game exits without memory or DirectX Object leaks.
- Follow the requirements / suggestions we talked about in class:

  - Use header guardbands in all your header files.
  - Be const correct.
  - Pass by reference and return by value (where appropriate).
  - Use initializer lists in your constructors.
  - Properly inline smaller methods and operators (say less than 10 lines).Try to write code readable by others.

- Your application must compile without warnings.
