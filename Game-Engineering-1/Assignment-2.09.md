# Assignment 2.09 - Swept Separating Axis Collision Check

## Primary Requirements

- Implement a swept separating axis collision check as we discussed in our last class.
- Use it to detect collisions between objects in your game.
- You don't need to react to collisions but have some temporary way of notifying of a collision, like debug spew.
- Make sure you have a test case for rotated objects.

## Secondary Requirements

- Ensure your game exits without memory or DirectX Object leaks.
- Follow the requirements / suggestions we talked about in class:
  - Think about the helpful rules on creating classes and inheritance we discussed in class.
  - Use header guardbands in all your header files.
  - Be const correct.
  - Pass by reference and return by value (where appropriate).
  - Use initializer lists in your constructors.
  - Properly inline smaller methods and operators (say less than 10 lines).Try to write code readable by others.
- Submit all files for building the application. This include:
  - Any necessary source files (.cpp, .h, etc.)
  - Visual Studio Solution and Project files (.sln, optional .suo, .vcproj, optional .vcprojfilters)
- Your application must compile without warnings.
- There should be no unnecessary files (.obj, .pdb, .exe, etc.) in your applications folder in your SVN trunk directory or tags directory.
- Must be submitted to your tags folder in a directory labeled "Assignment2.09"
