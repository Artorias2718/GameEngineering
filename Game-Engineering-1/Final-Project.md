# Final Project - An Actual Working Game

## Primary Requirements

- For your Final Project you need to submit an actual working game.
- It should have some kind of gameplay. You can keep it simple if you want (Pong or Breakout would be fine).
- It should end in some way, whether through the player losing or wining.
- Your focus should be on:
  - Submitting a clean, well architected code base.
  - A crash free application.
  - A memory leak free application.
  - Using the systems we've learned and developed this semester (Collision, Physics, Messaging, etc.)
- Include a readme.txt (in the root directory) that explains gameplay.
- If you have some code or system you're particularly proud of you may point it out in the readme.txt and I will look at it when grading.
- If you have questions  email me.

## Secondary Requirements

- Ensure your game exits without memory or DirectX Object leaks.
- Follow the requirements / suggestions we talked about in class:
  - Think about the helpful rules on creating classes and inheritance we discussed in class.
  - Use header guardbands in all your header files.
  - Be const correct.
  - Pass by reference and return by value (where appropriate).
  - Use initializer lists in your constructors.
  - Properly inline smaller methods and operators (say less than 10 lines).Try to write code readable by others.
- Submit all files for building the application. This include:
  - Any necessary source files (.cpp, .h, etc.)
  - Visual Studio Solution and Project files (.sln, optional .suo, .vcproj, optional .vcprojfilters)
- Your application must compile without warnings.
- There should be no unnecessary files (.obj, .pdb, .exe, etc.) in your applications folder in your SVN trunk directory or tags directory.
- Must be submitted to your tags folder in a directory labeled "Final Project"
