# Assignment 1.01 - Project Setup

## Primary Requirements

- Application must print "Hello World".
- Submission must include a Visual Studio 2013 solution.
- Submit all files for building the application. This includes:
  - Any necessary source files (.cpp, .h, etc.)
  - Visual Studio solution and project files (.sln, optional .suo, .vcproj, optional .vcprojfilters)
- SVN logs must show a submission to your trunk folder AND at least one commit to your trunk, with a descriptive commit message. One way to do this is to submit the application without the code that prints "Hello World", then add the code that prints "Hello World" and commit that change.

## Secondary Requirements

- Your application must compile without warnings.
- There should be no unnecessary files (.obj, .pdb, .exe, etc.) in your applications folder in your svn trunk directory or tags directory.
