# Assignment 1.10.02 - Dynamic Memory Allocation in Class

## Primary Requirements

- If it doesn't have it already add a const char * name member variable to your Actor class.
- It should be dynamically allocated in the constructor and copied from a parameter passed by the user to the constructor.
- Ensure each Actor instance in your game has a unique name.

## Secondary Requirements

- Ensure your game exits without memory leaks.
- Follow the requirements / suggestions we talked about in class:
  - Think about the helpful rules on creating classes and inheritance we discussed in class.
  - Use header guardbands in all your header files.
  - Be const correct.
  - Pass by reference and return by value (where appropriate).
  - Use initializer lists in your constructors.
  - Properly inline smaller methods and operators (say less than 10 lines).
  - Try to write code readable by others.
- Submit all files for building the application. This include:
  - Any necessary source files (.cpp, .h, etc.)
  - Visual Studio Solution and Project files (.sln, optional .suo, .vcproj, optional .vcprojfilters)
- Your application must compile without warnings.
- There should be no unnecessary files (.obj, .pdb, .exe, etc.) in your applications folder in your SVN trunk directory or tags directory.
- Must be submitted to your tags folder in a directory labeled "Assignment1.10.02"
