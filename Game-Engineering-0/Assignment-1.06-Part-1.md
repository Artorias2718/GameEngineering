# Assignment 1.06.01 - Inlining

## Primary Requirements

- Go through the class you wrote to represent a point or vector in 3d space. Inline the methods and operators you think should be inlined (small, simple methods)
  - Remember the compiler needs access to the method or function body at the time it's compiling uses of it.
- Use the debugger to verify that at least one of your inlines is working.
- Along with assignment submit a screenshot of disassembled code showing the inlining working.
- Look through the rest of your code for places where inlining functions is appropriate

## Secondary Requirements

- There should be no unnecessary files (.obj, .pdb, .exe, etc.) in your applications folder in your SVN trunk directory or tags directory.
- Make sure your code compiles without warnings.
- Must be copied from your trunk to your tags folder in a directory labeled "Assignment1.06.01" There should be no unnecessary files (.obj, .pdb, .exe, etc.) in your applications folder in your svn trunk directory or tags directory
