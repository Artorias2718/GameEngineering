# Assignment 4.08: Camera Collision

## Requirements

- Enhance the Third person camera to not clip through world geometry
  - The camera should not clip through the world geometry. (within reason)
  - Keep the player character in the view. (But the player does not necessarily need to stay in the center of the view.)
    - If collision geometry comes between the player character and the camera, the camera should reposition to maintain an unobstructed view.
  - No abrupt transitions (within reason)
