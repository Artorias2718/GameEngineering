# Final Project

## Requirements

- This assignment must be completed on your own, *no groups*.  Any duplicate assignments will be rejected.
- Make a program that utilizes the concepts learned during this class
  - Use at least 3 different AI technologies (i.e. Pathfinding, State Machines, & Sequential Prediction)
  - The program must be interactive... an on-screen human character, or a virtual interaction like in the Tic-Tac-Toe assignment.
  - The AI must respond to the human interaction in some way.
  - The AI does not need to be an opponent.
- Write a paper describing the AI used in your program
  - Include at least one paragraph to describe the "high-level" goal of your AI
  - Include at least one paragraph for each AI technology used in requirement 1.a.
    - These paragraphs should include specific implementation details.  How complex is your State Machine? How many nodes is your A* Pathfinding searching?  What kind of mutation rate are you using in your Genetic Algorithm? etc.
    - This is not just busy work.  I am genuinely interested!
  - Submit the paper with the program.
- Since this is the final assignment it will be graded on the quality of the submission, not the submission date.
