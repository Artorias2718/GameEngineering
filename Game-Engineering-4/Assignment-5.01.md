# Assignment 5.01: Pursue/Evade

## Requirements

- Make an environment, in Unity, using C#, where 2D game objects can be visualized with real-time execution.
  - Provide a means to draw "debug" lines to represent vectors.
- Create a 'target' game entity that moves at a constant velocity, with random initial position, orientation, and speed.
- Create a game entity that uses the 'Pursue' steering behavior to track the target.
  - Visualize the pursue target location.
- Create a game entity that uses the 'Evade' steering behavior to evade the target.
- Use debug lines to visualize velocity vectors and steering vectors.
- Basically, make [this](http://www.red3d.com/cwr/steer/PursueEvade.html)
- I have put together a Unity project that can act as a framework for this assignment.  You don't have to use it... it's optional: Pursue-Evade.zip
- For those asking about Vector projection, [Unity Docs](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Vector3.Project.html) have you covered
